# The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:
# 
# 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
# 
# Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:
# 
#      1: 1
#      3: 1,3
#      6: 1,2,3,6
#     10: 1,2,5,10
#     15: 1,3,5,15
#     21: 1,3,7,21
#     28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
# 
# We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.
# 
# What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

#  new theory.
#  if you take the prime factors, add 1 to all their exponents, and multiply them up, it's the number of divisors
